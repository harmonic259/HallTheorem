# HallTheorem
In this mini-project, I implemented the Hall algorithm for finding matching in a bipartite graph.
It takes a bipartite graph $G[X, Y]$ and an initial matching $M$ as input and outputs a matching that covers all vertices in $X$. Note that the input graph must satisfy Hall's hypothesis.
